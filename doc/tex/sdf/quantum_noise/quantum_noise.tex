\section{Quantum Noise}

\subsection*{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

This document describes a simple emission and detection system that uses coherent states as it's means?? of transmission???.\\
The transmitted information consists in a binary sequence which is ??translated?? in a sequence of coherent states. In this simulation, the used constellation is formed by the states $\{ \ket{\alpha}, \ket{i\alpha}, \ket{ - \alpha}, \ket{ - i \alpha} \}$, in which $\alpha$ is defined as $\braket{n} = |\alpha|^2$ ($\braket{n}$ is the expected number of photons in a state). (METER MELHOR) \\
\\
One of the main effects studied in this system is quantum noise, which is an intrinsic effect?? to coherent states(VER MARK FOX). In principle???? (VER REFERENCIAS) the variance of a coherent state is given by $\Delta X_1 \Delta X_2 = \frac{1}{4}$.\\
\\
But, given that we combine two photocurrents to obtain an output current, then the total noise will have a combined value of SOMETHING??? Procurar referencias.\\
\\
Therefore, assuming Gaussian?? (WHY GAUSSIAN?) shot noise, for each quadrature we want $\textrm{Var}(X_i) = \frac{1}{4}$ ?????\\
(TENHO DE PROCURAR REFERENCIAS)
\\
\\
In this simulation, we introduce quantum noise in the photodiodes.
We know that a coherent state has an expected number of photons distributed by a Poisson distribution, which has an average number equal to it's variance. Therefore, when the photodiode detects the power of signal, which is proportional to the number of photons, then it's variance must also be proportional to the number of photons.\\
\\
In fact the last step in detecting the resulting signal introduces an difference between currents, but that only will increase the variance. Assuming the independence between detections, and it's intrinsic noise (PROCURAR MELHOR PALEIO), then:
$$
\textrm{Var}(I_{out}) = \textrm{Var}(I_1) + \textrm{Var}(I_2)
$$
Therefore, the best result we can achieve will be $\textrm{Var}(X) = \frac{1}{4}$ ???? (PROCURAR PALEIO SOBRE ISTO)\\

\subsection*{Functional Description}

The simulation setup is described by diagram in figure \ref{fig:setup}. We start by generating a state from one of the four available ones.???? Then, the signal is received in a Hybrid Detector??? where the signal is compared with a local oscillator giving four different signals in it's output. Two of those signals are detected by a photodiode which output will be the difference of the two photocurrents. The other two signals will be also be detected by another photodiode, which will obtain the other quadrature of the signal.????? (TEM QUE FICAR MELHOR EXPLICADO).

\subsection*{Simulation Results}\label{subsec:SHresults}

The objective of this simulation was to get the (quantum noise???) associated to the detection of coherent states.\\

\label{fig:constelation}
\end{figure}
\\
We expect that the variance is invariant with the number of photons sent from Alice. The plot in \ref{fig:variance} show that the simulation also shows this invariance with the number of photons.\\

\label{fig:variance}
\end{figure}
We can conclude that the expected variance will give us $\textrm{Var(X)} = \frac{1}{2}$.\\
The results obtained in our simulations are in accordance with the theoretical prevision???
