######################################## October 2017 ##############################################
2017-10-26
TO BE DONE
  - go to the lab and setup a proper place to conduct the experiment (put a sheet with the experimental setup and a short description + student and supervisor name)
  - go to the lab and implement the experimental setup (and write which components are missing)
  - start with the simulation setup, write the "kramers_kronig_transceiver_sdf.cpp" file.
  - improve the theoretical part
  
Next meeting: Friday, 3/11, 8:30 am
