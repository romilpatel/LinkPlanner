TO BE DONE
  - go to the lab and setup a proper place to conduct the experiment (put a sheet with the experimental setup and a short description + student and supervisor name)
  - go to the lab and implement the experimental setup (and write which components are missing)
  - start with the simulation setup, write the "kramers_kronig_transceiver_sdf.cpp" file.
  - improve the theoretical part
  
Next meeting: Friday, 3/11, 8:30 am

2017-10-20
TO BE DONE
 - Improve the theoretical part;
 - Finish the simulation setup including description
 - check which blocks are already in the simulator and which are not
 - experimental setup transmitter part (low priority)

Next meeting: Friday, 27/10, 8:30 am

2017-10-17
TO BE DONE
 - Finish the simulation setup (top priority)
 - Improve the theoretical part;



2017-10-09
TO BE DONE
- make clear the goal of your work: to apply the Stokes PolDemux algorithm to a KK receiver
- Improve the text (theory)
- Start to write a simulation section
- Start to write a experimental section

Next meeting: 2017-10-17, 2 pm

2017-10-02
TO BE DONEI
Next meeting 
- What are the requirements for the KK receiver? (Minimum Phase Signal and Analytical Signal)
- What is the definition (Minimum Phase Signal and Analytical Signal)?
- How we can use these signals and profit from?

Later
Hilbert Transform
How to generate?


2017-09-14
TO BE DONE
- study two papers (Mecozzi16, Mecozzi17)
- write in our own words the system setup (explain)
- reproduce the results in NetXPTO - LinkPlanner
