TO BE DONEI
Next meeting 
- What are the requirements for the KK receiver? (Minimum Phase Signal and Analytical Signal)
- What is the definition (Minimum Phase Signal and Analytical Signal)?
- How we can use these signals and profit from?

Later
Hilbert Transform
How to generate?


2017-09-14
TO BE DONE
- study two papers (Mecozzi16, Mecozzi17)
- write in our own words the system setup (explain)
- reproduce the results in NetXPTO - LinkPlanner
